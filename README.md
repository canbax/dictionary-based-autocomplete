At first I wanted to generate a lemmatizer for turkish. But choosing the best word from suggestions is hard. So this code just gets suggestions for a phrase. It chooses the most similar words from dictionary.

It generates trie from dictionary. Dictionary consists of words which are consequtive alphabetic characters with no space. The algorithm exploits trie data structure to find suggestions fast. bfs function is a recursive function to traverse the nodes of trie. 

To make realistic suggestions, it uses letter alternatives. Based on alternatives of letter it traces alternative paths of trie. If there are extra letters in phrase, it could still find the implied word. If there are missing letters, it might not.

Turkish dictionary generated by merging words from different sources. It contains 78273 words
